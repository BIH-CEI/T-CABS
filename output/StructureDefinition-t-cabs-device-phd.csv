","Item used in healthcare","The characteristics, operational status and capabilities of a medical-related component of a medical device.

Examples for such a node are MDS, VMD, or Channel.

With PHD medical units, there is no medical scanner and the unit is only a single node, a single 'simple' MDS, and it is static. Thus a PHD has no parent 'Device'.  When a PHD supports multiple device specializations, the single unit description is still the case. A specialization is just an way to organize a set of metric objects that tend to be generated by a single sensor, but the device could expose metric objects from several specializations which usually means it has more than one sensor. In PHDs multiple specialization support is rare.","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Device",0,*,"","dom-2:If the resource is contained in another resource, it SHALL NOT contain nested Resources {contained.contained.empty()}
